This package contains the analysis rules used internally at I.C.N.H GmbH.

It mainly follows the style of the Flutter team and otherwise incorporates [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart). We prefer `final` over `var`but do not add type informations if they can be safely omitted.
